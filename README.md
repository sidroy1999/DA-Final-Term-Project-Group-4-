PROBLEM STATEMENT-
By utilizing the South German Credit dataset, the offered Python solution tackles a challenge related to credit risk classification. The information includes a number of financial characteristics, including age, amount, and duration. After preprocessing the data, the objective is to estimate credit risk (1 or 0) using a RandomForestClassifier. Tasks like data cleansing (managing missing values, renaming columns), exploratory data analysis (visualizing distributions, identifying and eliminating outliers), and building a machine learning pipeline are all included in the code. In the pipeline, a RandomForestClassifier is trained and numerical features are scaled. A confusion matrix is used to illustrate the results of the model's evaluation, which is based on a test set accuracy score and classification report.
The code also shows how to anticipate something for a new piece of data. The project's overall goal is to develop a credit risk assessment prediction model using historical financial data.

INTERPRETATION
Outliers are eliminated from the dataset by preprocessing, which might be essential for enhancing model performance.
- The correlation matrix facilitates comprehension of feature relationships.
- The accuracy score and classification report indicate that the RandomForestClassifier achieves an accuracy of roughly 76%.
- The confusion matrix sheds light on how well the model performs for each of the two classes.
A fresh data point's interpretation reveals the expected result for credit risk.
